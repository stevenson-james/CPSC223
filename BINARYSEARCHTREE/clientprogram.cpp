/*
This program creates a dictinoary of texting abbreviations and lets the client decide what
	they want to do with the texting abbreviations. The client has the option to insert
	a new texting abbreviation, search for an abbreviation, list the abbreviations on the
	screen, print the texting abbreviations (in a PRETTY fashion) to the screen, rebalance 
	the texting abbreviation(which involves turning the inorder texting abbreviations into 
	a full tree), save the dictionary that was created to a file(dictionary.dat) and finally 
	exiting the program.
